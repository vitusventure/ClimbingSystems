# Sport Cragging Gearlist

Here is a list of the gear I usually bring with me when heading up to a sport crag. I usually climb in the Pacific Northwest, specifically in the Exit 38 crags near Seattle, or Frenchman Coulee near Vantage (all in Washington).

I usually carry two belay devices (GriGri2 for belaying, ATC Guide for rappelling). I like the autolocking function of the GriGri, but prefer to rappel with a more traditional tube device. For most of my cragging, the approaches are short, so the extra weight is not an issue. However, if the approaches were longer, I would ditch the GriGri2.

## Climbing Gear
* Harness (Edelrid Jay)
* 12 Quickdraws (Black Diamond Freewire, 12cm)
* 2 alpine draws [I use these mostly to extend anchors when needed] (CAMP Photon Wire with 60cm Mammut Contact 8.0 sling)
* Rope (Edelrid Boa Eco, 9.8mm, non-dry)
* Belay Device (Petzl GriGri2)
* Locking D carabiner [For attaching belay device] (Petzl Spirit Screwlock)
* Edelrid Ohm [My usual partner is heavier than me, so this is a lifesaver when he leads]
* Climbing shoes (Scarpa Force V)
* Chalk bag

## Cleaning/Rappelling Gear
Most climbs that I frequent require rappelling after cleaning, rather than lowering

* Double length sling (Black Diamond, nylon)
* HollowBlock (Sterling, 13.5")
* D Carabiner [For securing third hand backup] (Black Diamond Positron)
* Small HMS locking carabiner [For anchoring with sling] (Black Diamond Mini Pearabiner)
* Rappel Device (Black Diamond ATC Guide)
* HMS locking carabiner (Black Diamond Rocklock)

## Safety Gear
* Helmet (Petzl Boreo)
* First Aid Kit (REI Weekend backpacking kit, with added matches, flashlight, and toilet paper)
* Cell Phone (Nokia 3310)

## Other items
* Relevant guidebook
* Food
* Water (Platypus 1l bottle)
